# Requirement Analysis in Software Development  
This documentation is dedicated to documenting the Requirement Analysis phase for the Airbnb-clone project. It aims to capture and clarify the essential needs of the system before development begins. The document within this repo will cover:  

- A clear explanation of Requirement Analysis and its importance in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
- A breakdown of Functional and Non-functional Requirements, including how they differ.
- Key reasons why Requirement Analysis is critical in successful software development.
- The core activities involved in conducting Requirement Analysis.
- An illustration of how Use Case Diagrams support the identification and communication of system functionality.
- Guidance on establishing and applying Acceptance Criteria to validate requirements during testing and delivery.  

The purpose of this analysis is to ensure that the development of the Airbnb clone is guided by a solid understanding of user and system expectations, reducing risks and aligning the final product with project goals.

## What is Requirement Analysis   
This is a critical phase in SDLC where the project team **gathers**, **analyzes**, and **defines** the requirements of the software development product to be developed. It helps define what the client wants, what users expect, and what the development team must build.  

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important  
**1. Clarity and Understanding** - Developers, designers, testers, and stakeholders share a common understanding of the project's goals. This shared understanding prevents confusion and rework later.    
**2. Scope definition** - It helps define the scope of the project, meaning what will be included and what wonâ€™t. This avoids feature creep (adding more than originally planned) and helps manage expectations.  
**3. Basis for design and development** - It provides the foundation for the next stages: system design and development. Designers use requirements to create the user interface and user experience. Developers use them to write the logic and build the actual features.   
**4. Quality assurance** - Clearly defined requirements serve as a benchmark for testing the software. Testers use them to create test cases and validate whether the system behaves as expected.
